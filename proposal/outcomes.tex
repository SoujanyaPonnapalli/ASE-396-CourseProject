\section{Desired Outcomes and Milestones}

This section outlines the milestones and the high-level goals of our work. This
work aims at the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Designing the model of Persistent Memory
    \item Simulating the persistent memory model with the \checker library
    \item Formalizing the correctness and crash consistency properties of
      PM-Indexes as ltl-formulas
    \item Using the \checker library to model and verify a state-of-the-art
      PM-Index, like the RECIPE data structures~\cite{LeeEtAl19-Recipe}.
\end{enumerate}

To achieve the following goals here are a few concrete milestones to be hit:
1) \textbf{Weeks 1-2}: Understanding SPIN and reading the related work
2) \textbf{Week 2-4}: Choosing a PM-Index and designing the model and specs
3) \textbf{Week 4-6}: Implementing the \checker, modeling the PM-Index,
verifying the properties, and addressing the scalability challenges.
