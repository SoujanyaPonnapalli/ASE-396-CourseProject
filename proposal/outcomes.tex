\section{Desired Outcomes and Milestones}

This section outlines the milestones and the high-level goals of our work. This
work aims at the following: \\
1) Designing the model of Persistent Memory\\
2) Simulating the persistent memory model with the \checker library\\
3) Formalizing the correctness and crash consistency properties of PM-Indexes as
ltl-formulas\\
4) Using the \checker library to model and verify a state-of-the-art PM-Index,
like the RECIPE data structures~\cite{LeeEtAl19-Recipe}\\

To achieve the following goals here are a few concrete milestones to be hit:
1) \textbf{Weeks 1-2}: Understanding SPIN and reading the related work
2) \textbf{Week 2-4}: Choosing a PM-Index and designing the model and specs
3) \textbf{Week 4-7}: Implementing the \checker, modeling the PM-Index,
verifying the properties, and addressing the scalability challenges.
