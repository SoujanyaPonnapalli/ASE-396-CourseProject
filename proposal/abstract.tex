\begin{abstract}
The advent of the Storage Class Memory (SCM), that is fast and byte-addressable
  similar to Random Access Memory (DRAM or SRAM), and is persistent like SSDs
  and hard disks, has attracted researchers to develop persistent memory data
  structures to promote its adoption. However building efficient data
  structures for persistent memory that allow concurrent accesses to the data
  is challenging:
  1) The caches and registers remain volatile, requiring data structures to use
  explicit flush instructions to ensure that the data reaches persistent memory
  2) The cache flush instructions can be reordered with load and store
  instructions, requiring data structures to place fences between instructions
  that have to execute in order for correctness. As fence and flush
  instructions incur heavy performance penalty and are crucial for correctness,
  the application developers should not insert these instructions unless they
  are strictly required for correctness. This tradeof between performance and
  correctness complicates the design of persistent memory data structures and
  makes it extremely hard to reason about their correctness.

This paper aims at model checking persistent memory data structures for
  correctness and crash-consistency with a novel library. It introduces
  \checker library for the SPIN model checker that verifies that
  a persistent memory data structure is correct, \ie it does not allow any
  instruction reorderings that can corrupt the data. It also checks that the
  persistent memory data structure is crash consistent, \ie the data
  is never in an inconsistent state in the face of power failures or crashes.
  Overall, \checker models the relaxed memory model of persistent memory,
  formalizes the specifications for correctness and crash consistency. We
  demonstrate the use of \checker by verifying a few state-of-the-art
  persistent memory data structures.
