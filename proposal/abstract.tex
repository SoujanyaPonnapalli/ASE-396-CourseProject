The advent of the Storage Class Memory (SCM) that is fast and byte-addressable
  similar to the Random Access Memory (DRAM or SRAM) and is persistent like the
  SSDs and hard disks, has attracted researchers to develop efficient data
  structures for adopting this persistent memory. However building efficient
  data structures for persistent memory that allow concurrent accesses to the
  data is challenging for two main reasons:
  1) The caches and registers remain volatile and require applications to flush
  the data from the caches to the persistent memory for durability
  2) The cache flush instructions are reordered with load and store instructions
  in accordance to the memory model of the persistent memory and require
  applications to place fences to enforce ordering between these instructions.
  As fence and flush instructions incur heavy performance penalty and are
  crucial for correctness, the application developers should not insert these
  instructions unless they are strictly required for correctness. This tradeof
  between performance and correctness complicates the design of persistent
  memory data structures and makes it extremely hard to reason about their
  correctness.

This paper aims at model checking persistent memory data structures for
  correctness and crash-consistency with a novel library. It introduces
  PM-CHECKER library for the SPIN model checker that verifies that
  a persistent memory data structure is correct, \ie it does not allow any
  instruction reorderings that can corrupt the data. It also checks that the
  persistent memory data structure is crash consistent, \ie the data
  is never in an inconsistent state in the face of power failures or crashes.
  Overall, PM-CHECKER models the relaxed memory model of persistent memory,
  formalizes the specifications for correctness and crash consistency. We
  demonstrate the use of PM-CHECKER by verifying a few state-of-the-art
  persistent memory data structures.
